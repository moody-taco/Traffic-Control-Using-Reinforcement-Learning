# How to Run
Run the [training.py](https://github.com/moody-taco/Traffic-Control-Using-Reinforcement-Learning/blob/main/training.py) file to train the agent.   
Set GUI to True to view, play and pause the simulation. (Only recommended for visualization, not recommended for training)

# Variations
In the [model.py](https://github.com/moody-taco/Traffic-Control-Using-Reinforcement-Learning/blob/main/model.py) file, comments marked with #AC are variations for Batch Normalization, LSTM and GRU.
